h1. ROAR

_Streamlines the development of RESTful, resource-oriented architectures in Ruby._


h2. Introduction

*Note:* This is a WIP, don't blame us if the API changes ;-)

ROAR is an attempt to provide a useful framework for developing ROAs in Ruby. It bundles all the great tools we have and defines generic, simple interfaces to have real RESTful behaviour. Most applications simply expose CRUD operations via HTTP, whereas ROAR encourages you to use the power of different resource representations, content negotiation, HATEOAS and more.

h2. Dependencies

Currently it relies on the following gems:

* ActiveModel
* Restfulie
